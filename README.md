# Movie Genre Classification

**1. Objective**
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that classifies movies into genres based on their plot descriptions. The steps include:

Collecting and cleaning text-based movie plot descriptions.

Converting raw text into numerical vectors (e.g., using TF-IDF, word embeddings, or other NLP techniques).

Experimenting with multiple classifiers (e.g., Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, or neural networks) to determine the best performing model.

Evaluating the final model’s accuracy and analyzing feature importance and misclassifications.

**2. Project Structure**
Folders and Files
data/: Contains the dataset and related files.

raw/: Original data.

processed/: Preprocessed text data.

labels.csv: Ground truth labels for each movie’s genre.

notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and experimentation.

src/: Python scripts for data processing, feature engineering, training, and evaluation.

scripts/: Shell scripts (or additional Python scripts) for automating tasks (training, evaluation, etc.).

requirements.txt: List of Python packages required to run the project.

config.yaml: Configuration file for hyperparameters (e.g., vectorizer settings, classifier parameters).

main.py: Optional single entry point to run your entire pipeline (data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation).
